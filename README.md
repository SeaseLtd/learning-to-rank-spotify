##### A Learning to Rank Project on a Daily Song Ranking Problem

This is a project that began as part of an internal Machine Learning Multidisciplinary Hackathon where the objective was to adapt the Spotify dataset on Worldwide Daily Song Ranking (available here https://www.kaggle.com/edumucelli/spotifys-worldwide-daily-song-ranking) to a Learning to Rank task.

The repository contains the code to set up and build a Learning to Rank (LTR) system starting from the available data, creating and manipulating the training set and the test set, and then training a ranking model using open source libraries.

More details about the project are available in the following blog posts:
